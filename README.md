Project Overview
This project is focused on developing a crop recommendation system using machine learning algorithms. The aim is to provide farmers with recommendations on the most suitable crops to plant based on specific environmental factors like soil conditions, temperature, and humidity. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system helps optimize crop production and improve farming efficiency.

Features
Data preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numeric features.
Implementation of machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes to predict suitable crops.
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Easy-to-use interface for farmers to input data and get crop recommendations.
Dataset
The dataset contains essential agricultural data such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall. These features are used to predict the most suitable crop for planting in a particular region.
Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies installed:

Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries listed in requirements.txt

Model Evaluation
The machine learning models are evaluated using several metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions made by the model.
Precision: The percentage of true positives out of the total positive predictions.
Recall: The percentage of actual positives correctly predicted by the model.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single measure of the modelâ€™s performance.
